# quantum_state_simulator_RBM

This project aims to explore the ground state properties of the quantum Ising model using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The quantum Ising model is a fundamental model in condensed matter physics and is used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. RBMs are unsupervised learning algorithms used for various machine learning tasks, including feature learning and generative modeling. In this project, we implement an RBM and train it using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to approximate the ground state of the Ising model.

## Features

- Implementation of a custom RBM class to represent the quantum Ising model
- Calculation of the Hamiltonian and energy expectation values for the Ising model
- Sampling of quantum states using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
- Training the RBM using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to find the ground state
- Calculation of local energy for the Ising model

This project offers a hands-on approach to the study of the Ising model and its properties, as well as an exploration of using machine learning techniques to solve complex quantum mechanical problems.
